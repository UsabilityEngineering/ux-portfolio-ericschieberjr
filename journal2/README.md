# UX Journal 2 - iPhone X User Experience

## Eric Schieber Jr, 05/02/2021

   When the second journal entry was posted, I was having trouble thinking about what I was going to write about for this journal entry. However, after driving to a housewarming party and interacting with my friend's iPhone X, I have decided that this is the experience that I will write my second journal entry about.

   To explain my experience, I will start off by saying, I have had an iPhone 7 Plus since the model first came out. Knock on wood, but my phone has not died on me and is still alive and kicking. Therefore, I have not had the opportunity to upgrade my iPhone for years. Since my first purchase of my iPhone 7 Plus, many new iPhone models have been released. To put into perspective, the latest model of iPhone is currently the 12th generation. With these new models came the ridding of the physical home button. Below I have a screenshot showing the pysical button I'm talking about. The button is in the green box.

   As we were driving to our friend's housewarming party, my friends had requested that I put on some music. Since my friend's phone was already connected to the car’s audio system, I decided to use his phone. My friend’s phone is an iPhone X. After unlocking the phone, I was presented with a screen showing an open tab in the Google Chrome iPhone app. Knowing that I wanted to access his Spotify app, I instinctively went to press the home button with my thumb. At the time, I pondered and thought to myself how interesting it was that the physical home button on my iPhone 7 had become so **memorable** for me, that I didn’t even think twice when trying to press it with my thumb.

   After realizing the button wasn’t there, I had remembered watching my friend use his iPhone X in the past. To my recollection, I remember my friend swiping his thumb in different directions to navigate through the screens on his phone. With this information in mind, I naturally swiped my thumb up to see what would happen. The screenshot below is from an online tutorial on how to get to the home page using an iPhone X. You can imagine that I did the same motion but with my thumb instead of my index finger. After attempting my best guess, I was presented with a familiar screen. The screen I saw was a screen in iOS that allows the user to close out open applications running in the background. This screen on an iPhone 7 can be prompted by pressing the physical home button twice. Below the first image is another image showing the screen I am talking about. I scanned this screen with my eyes looking for any indication as to how to return to the home screen. I could not find anything. The only thing I could do was return to the app I was just in along with any other apps that were already running in the background.

   Desperate to get the music going for my friend’s enjoyment, I reached out to my friend who owns the iPhone X and asked him how to return to the home screen. He then proceeded to demonstrate to me how to return to the home screen. To my surprise, all I had to do was tap the part of the screen that contained a blurred out background of my home screen. Also to my surprise, I learned that I was able to do this on my iPhone 7 as well! After being taught how to navigate back to the home screen, I was good to go to get the party going. Below is an edited version of the previous image to show exactly where I tapped the screen to return to the home page. The green circle is where I tapped.

   Reflecting on that experience, I think about a lot of things. One of the biggest things I think about is how **learnable** and **memorable** this particular user experience was. The fact that I without any hesitation thought that swiping my thumb up could get rid of the current screen I was on, shows me that Apple in recent years has really tried to focus on and study human’s instinctive movements when it comes to navigating screens. If something already feels like the natural thing to do, it only makes it that much easier to learn and remember. With all of that being said, I believe that Apple has completely satisfied those particular usability goals.

   Another thing I think about is the level of **satisfaction** that comes with the new way of navigating iPhone screens. Personally, I am a sucker for the physical feedback that comes with clicking things, typing, pressing buttons, etc. With a swiping motion, I can definitely say it is not as **satisfying** as pressing a physical button that clicks. I do not think that this is detrimental to the overall user experience, but it’s something that I definitely noticed and thought should be mentioned.

   Lastly, I will say that I think this experience was overall fairly **efficient.** After getting over the learning curve, I had begun to notice how much faster the swiping gestures had made it for me to navigate within the iPhone. I could only imagine how quickly I could get to my desired screen once I had built up the proper amount of muscle memory. Though the difference in time between the using swiping gestures and using buttons is miniscule, I could see how using swiping gestures over time would make the need for the physical button less and less necessary.
